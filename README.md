## Purpose
LA Fitness members and guests check in software (FDMT) does what it's intended, though 
* it could be better, 
* it could be more accessible, 
* easier to navigate, 
* less clunky,
* easier on the eyes,
* perform faster despite the users's list

I have played around with the FDMT program and decided to make my own version, which I feel addresses the many issues that my co-workers have voiced about.
I have added a feature that allows real time tracking from most devices, allowing the front desk freedom to move about  the facility, without being a slave to the front desk, in the very case he or she is working solo.

This software did not collect user's data from LA Fitness,  everything is mocked.
